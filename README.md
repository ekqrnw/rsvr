# RSVR
VR plugin for runelite. Currently only works with oculus in classic layout mode. 

Uses runescape's projection (will look flatter zoomed in and more 3D zoomed out).

## Controls:
This plugin uses a robot to click/move the mouse and requires the runelite window to have focus.

The triangle is the orientation/position of the controller. 

The line is guided by where the triangle points and represents the location of the cursor in the world as viewed from the window.

Use middle click and drag to rotate the world.

The left controller controls the position/visibility of the UI.

UI visibility can be toggled, hover the triangle over the UI to interact with UI elements.

If a widget is open, UI visibility is forced.

### There are different modes that can be entered:

Grey triangle/line: You are hovering the world and are free to click. Left and right clicks will work on world elements. 

Red triangle/line: You are not hovering the world and clicks are disabled. You are either out of the world bounds or are hovering a widget.

Blue triangle/no line: You are selecting in a menu (normal clicks are disabled). Navigate with the right controller buttons and left click to select.

White triangle/no line: You are hovering the UI. Clicks here will work as they do in the normal window.

### Oculus:
Right trigger: Left click

Right grip: Right click

Right joystick button: Middle click

X button: Show/hide UI

A/B: Menu select
